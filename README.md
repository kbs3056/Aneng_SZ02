7.4.3 Dropout Operation
If the input voltage is lower than the nominal output voltage plus the specified dropout voltage, but all other
conditions are met for normal operation, the device operates in dropout mode. In this mode, the output voltage
tracks the input voltage. During this mode, the transient performance of the device becomes significantly
degraded because the pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region, and acts as a switch. Line or load
transients in dropout can result in large output voltage deviations.
